# sokoban
Sokoban game in C++, based on a template (just for graphical display), for Programming course on my studies.

NOTE: 
 - the code is not written using OOP - it was an exercise during the first part of Programming course, when OOP principles were not yet introduced.
 - the graphical display is performed using template provided by Politechnika Gda≈Ñska, ETI faculty - all ccredits goes to them for this part. The whole game code however was created by me.
 - SDL is required to display the graphics
